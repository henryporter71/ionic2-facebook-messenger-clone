Messenger Clone
===============

A humble attempt to clone facebook messenger in Ionic 2 - using the latest and best tools the platform can afford.
Most of this attempt has been channeled towards the interface. I badly would like to add the server layers necessary for a fully functional truly messenger-like experience.

Unlucky note: Facebook messenger UI updates kinda frequently - just incase this looks totally different from what you have :)

Another unlucky note: Ionic 2 barely became stable before Ionic 3 was announced. You get the gist? - expect frequent "breaking" changes.
This same applies to Angular 2 which was still toddling when Angular 4 was announced.

Yet another unlucky note: Ionicons, the icon set used by ion-icons is not there yet. And not there yet could mean really far dependable. So expect a few unusual icons

And the last unlucky note: I don't have an iPhone, yes you can weep for me. But you get it - I don't know what this app looks like on iOS.


Purpose
-------
I was evaluting the use of Ionic for a real project and the potential to move future app developments to hybrid.
Problem is that there aren't many popular hybrid apps out there - whose code is remotely accessible.
And given that Ionic is young, I bet there'd be a lot of potholes. And here comes the mission:
To emulate a real-world native app using a hybrid framework - Ionic. 
And I further extended this to include a demonstration of the latest functionalities + hacks + prog. guidelines for having a real app on hybrid.

Essentially, it should significantly reduce the "risk" factor of moving to hybrid. That is, if we could have something like Facebook's "sophisticated" Messenger on hybrid.
